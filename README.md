### Scoring System
1. Salary Cap - every week each player has salary cap of 10k to select players based on rating
2. Choose your top 4 for MPO and FPO and 1 wild card each - wild card will be player you believe to play most above their rating - will be multiplier
3. Players will accumulate points based on where they finish regardless of order - except wild card - this is the player you believe will finish well but also farther above their rating


## Scoring System

| 1 | 250 | 250 |
