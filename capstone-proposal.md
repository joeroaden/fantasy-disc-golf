## Name of Project: 
Fantasy Disc Golf

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The goal of this project is to provide more reasons to watch live disc golf and get more enjoyment out of a tournament even when the top few positions are already locked in going into the final round.  Fantasy disc golf will allow users to compete against each other for points each week by selecting their top 6 players plus wild card for men and women at each disc golf event. The disc golf pro tour has regular events each month and also silver series events nearly every weekend.  The initial goal is to have each week be its own event so anyone can jump in and play anytime.  Users can establish their own leagues each week or compete in the general pool among all users.
