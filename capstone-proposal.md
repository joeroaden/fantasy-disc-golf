## Name of Project: 
Fantasy Disc Golf

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
The goal of this project is to provide more reasons to watch live disc golf and get more enjoyment out of a tournament even when the top few positions are already locked in going into the final round.  Fantasy disc golf will allow users to compete against each other for points each week by selecting their top 4 players plus wild card for men and women at each disc golf event. The disc golf pro tour has regular events each month and also silver series events nearly every weekend.  The initial goal is to have each week be its own event so anyone can jump in and play anytime.  Stretch goals will allow users to establish their own leagues each week or compete in the general pool among all users.  

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Click on event to see details (Date, Time and Location, How to watch etc)
- See list of players for Men and Women playing each event
- Create your own team name
- Add each desired player to your roster - 5 men or 5 women
- View your selected players for that week


## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- JavaScript/REACT
- SQL Database or Firebase to store user teams and logins
- Will need an API to retrieve info from database



## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Incorporate Login for multiple users
- Include more detailed player profiles (stats, past finishes, etc)
- optimize app for mobile
- Scrape data from multiple websites to get player info and stats
- Allow teams and leagues for each user to join
- Functional Components with Hooks
- Show upcoming event
- Create Scoring System for picks - top 10 players worth less points than fringe players


## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- MVC or some other tool for logins
- Scraping tool 
- add more styling and optimize for mobile app


## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
- Disc Golf is one of my biggest passions and I would consider myself somewhat of an expert, so this project will allow me to share one of my passions with tons of people
